# CMPE 256 Hackathon: Food Security & Climate Resilience

### RAG Architecture | The State of Food Security and Nutrition 2024

---

## Overview

Welcome to the **CMPE 256 Hackathon** project repository! This hackathon focuses on addressing the urgent issue of food security through AI and data mining. In collaboration with PotatoCo, a leading global food distribution chain, our goal is to understand and forecast the impacts of climate change on crop production—particularly potatoes in India, a critical supplier. By leveraging climate, agriculture, and emissions data, we aim to build a robust model that supports climate adaptation strategies and sustains food availability worldwide.

## Problem Statement

**PotatoCo** has faced a substantial reduction in potato production from its primary suppliers, driven by climate change. This decrease poses risks not only to PotatoCo's supply chain but also to food prices and security. With a mission to provide low-cost, accessible food, PotatoCo seeks to harness advanced data analytics and machine learning to anticipate climate risks and create adaptation plans.

### Objectives

1. **Data Collection & Feature Engineering**: Identify and process key data sources, variables, and create synthetic variables.
2. **Climate Impact Analysis**: Assess the impact of climate changes on potato production.
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Build a model to forecast future crop yields and potential production disruptions.
4. **Data Visualization**: Develop an interactive dashboard for PotatoCo to track climate impacts on food security across various regions.

## Data Sources

Our analysis draws from diverse, reputable sources covering decades of agricultural and climate data:

- **Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)**: Crop production, area harvested, and yield data (1961-2020).
- **World Bank Climate Change Portal**: Temperature and precipitation trends in India.
- **FAO Emissions Database**: Emissions data from crop residues, fertilizer manufacturing, and direct emissions (N₂O, CH₄, CO₂).
- **FAO Fertilizer Usage Data**: Fertilizer application rates per area of cropland.

#### Key Files
- **SOFI-2023.pdf** / **SOFI-2024.pdf**: Annual reports on the state of food security.
- **Vision2050.pdf**: Reference guide for global climate adaptation strategies.
- **Climatology.zip**: Monthly and annual climatology data for India (1961-2020).
- **Fertilizers_FAOSTAT_data_en_12-3-2022.csv**: Fertilizer usage data.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, transforming, and feature engineering based on multiple datasets.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Deep analysis of trends in climate, fertilizer use, and potato yield.
3. **Modeling**: Time-series forecasting with Machine Learning models to predict future yields.
4. **Visualization**: Interactive dashboard development for live tracking and insights.
